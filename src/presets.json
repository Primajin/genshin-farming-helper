Apart from being quite sturdy, even to the point where you could use it for self-defense, it lacks any sort of special features. But the old adage holds true — \"the novice's rod shall be the tent-pole of their veterancy.\" Even the greatest of anglers must surely have started with this simple implement.","category":"FISH_ROD","typeText":"Fishing Rod","sources":["Obtain from quests"],"images":{"filename_icon":"UI_ItemIcon_200900"},"version":""},{"id":200901,"name":"Windtangler","rarity":4,"sortRank":62001,"description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Mondstadt.\n\nA long, bright, transparent rod created by a poet from Mondstadt. To help borrow the power of Anemo to help raise the rod, the poet rather ingeniously designed a fishing reel made from the leaves of Windwheel Asters, which also imparts a certain romanticism of \"lingering in the wind\" to this device. But perhaps there were issues in the handiwork or in the design itself, for the finalized product could not spin as freely as expected. Perhaps this is what they call \"the chasm between professions?\"","category":"FISH_ROD","typeText":"Fishing Rod","sources":["Exchange at the Mondstadt Fishing Association"],"images":{"filename_icon":"UI_ItemIcon_200901"},"version":""},{"id":200902,"name":"Wishmaker","rarity":4,"sortRank":62002,"description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Liyue.\n\nA long rod that stands like elegant bamboo. It is said to have been constructed and kept by a skilled hermit from Liyue, and it was first discovered on a stone tablet with the following words carved upon it: \"O you who aspire, take up this rod,\" like a legendary sword waiting for a hero to pull it out. Of course, you only ever hear this glorious origin story from the mouths of merchants, so it may just be some rhetoric used to increase the item's value...

This effect only works in Inazuma.\n\nA rod created to commemorate the ancient Ukai, or Cormorant, fishing method. The ruby-red gem at the tip of the rod represents the tinder used by the cormorant fishers, and the bird ornaments along the rod's shaft represent the cormorants themselves, who helped the hard-working Inazumans pass through those cataclysmic years. This low-efficiency fishing method has long become obsolete, but the persevering, pioneering spirit has been passed down together with this rod.","category":"FISH_ROD","typeText":"Fishing Rod","sources":["Exchange at the Inazuma Fishing Association"],"images":{"filename_icon":"UI_ItemIcon_200903"},"version":""},{"id":200904,"name":"Moonstringer","rarity":4,"sortRank":62004,"description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle at an accelerating rate and increase your chances of success. If you leave the Ideal Tension Zone, the acceleration will reset.\nA special fishing rod created for the sake of the Lunar Leviathan. To tackle this legendary fish, the creator of this rod specially added some material with rare functions onto the rod itself and the fishing line, giving it both great malleability and tensile strength. Of course, such a treasure could easily catch ordinary fish, but that seems like overkill to the point where even the rod might feel ashamed to be used thus.","category":"FISH_ROD","typeText":"Fishing Rod","sources":["Obtained From Event"],"images":{"filename_icon":"UI_ItemIcon_200904"},"version":""},{"id":200905,"name":"Serendipity","rarity":4,"sortRank":62005,"description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Sumeru.\n\nThis archaic Sumeru fishing rod is carved like white jade, decorated with dark gold patterns, and embellished with green gems. Under its pure aesthetics, it seems to have some meaning related to \"life\" — it is said that the oldest fishing rod of Sumeru was a branch wrapped with vines, and many master anglers achieved miraculous catches with such rods. Today's fishermen also believe that such fishing rods with long histories will bring them good luck.","category":"FISH_ROD","typeText":"Fishing Rod","sources":["Exchange at the Sumeru Fishing Association"],"images":{"filename_icon":"UI_ItemIcon_200905"},"version":"3.0"},{"id":200906,"name":"Wavepiercer","rarity":4,"sortRank":62006,"description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Fontaine.\n\nA slender fishing rod with a beautiful metallic glamor. Made of innovative metal materials designed by the Fontaine Research Institute, it combines light weight and resistance. Thanks to the solid metal loops reinforcing the connections between each section, the rod is capable of bearing fish of astonishing weight. Moreover, the reel seat is modeled after the handguards on weapon handles, protecting the angler from being damaged by fierce and \"tough\" fish. \nAccording to experienced fishers, this rod is the perfect weapon against \"Iron Fish,\" the specialty of Fontaine, and is comparable to a trusty lance.","category":"FISH_ROD","typeText":"Fishing Rod","sources":["Exchange at the Fontaine Fishing Association"],"images":{"filename_icon":"UI_ItemIcon_200906"},"version":"4.0"},{"id":200907,"name":"Flowhorn Flounderfinder","rarity":4,"sortRank":62007,"description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Natlan.\n\nA specialty rod of the Natlan Fishing Association. Crafted from weapons-grade metal, it has also been carved with a fine design that features Long-Necked Rhinos and Flowcurrent Birds, ensuring both durability and style.\nAnglers often speculate that, if only it felt inclined to harness the potential of its exceedingly long neck, the Long-Necked Rhino might become the most gifted fisher in the entire natural world. Meanwhile, the seemingly clumsy Flowcurrent Bird actually has to rely upon catching fish to survive. Together, therefore, they would make the perfect fishing partners — thus, having them both on the same rod is believed to bring anglers exceptional luck!","category":"FISH_ROD","typeText":"Fishing Rod","sources":["Exchange at the Natlan Fishing Association"],"images":{"filename_icon":"UI_ItemIcon_200907"},"version":"5.2"},{"id":200908,"name":"Moongleam Sapling","rarity":4,"sortRank":62008,"description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Nod-Krai.\n\nA fishing rod that shimmers with a pure, silvery glow, like moonlight caught in its frame. It's a masterpiece reserved for true masters among Nod-Krai's anglers, those who have reached the highest levels of the craft. It is said that the last wielder of this rod treated every catch as a quiet exchange rather than a contest. Some fish were released right away, while others were invited home for a short visit in the aquarium — before being gently returned to the waters they came from. This thoughtful, respectful way of fishing gave rise to a unique tradition among local anglers — one that values connection and care over mere skill.","category":"FISH_ROD","typeText":"Fishing Rod","sources":["Exchange at the Nod-Krai Fishing Association"],"images":{"filename_icon":"UI_ItemIcon_200908"},"version":"6.0"}]}
