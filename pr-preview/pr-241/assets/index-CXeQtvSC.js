Among sticklebacks, this sort would either count as the proudest, or a rather close second place. They are especially prickly during courtships, where even the slightest breeze or smallest ripple might trip their fuse. A hobbyist once observed one such specimen charging at waving seagrass, as if such flagrant dancing was some major provocation against the stickleback king or something.

Fleeing into the Dark Sea, the god that had lost everything met the abandoned people who had nothing within the ocean depths. Thus it elected to remain and become their "Orobashi no Mikoto," their "Watatsumi Omikami."
It is said that the great snake god once broke off all the coral branches on its body to give light to the children who were curled up in the darkness.

The meaning that lies behind the name "Watatsumi" is simply the unrequited hopes that the abandoned people who dwelt in the deep sea pinned upon the serpent god that led them.
And it was also because the serpent god now had people who worshiped it that it stayed in the world it should have long fled, breaking off the coral branches that adorned its body, treading upon land where it should not have, and facing a foe it could never hope to match — till at last, its divine form was sundered along with the mountains, its ichor turned into plasma, and its will and power became a curse that could never be extinguished: Tatarigami.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4343,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Sunken Sands",daysOfWeek:["Monday","Thursday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114028"},version:""},{id:114029,name:"Narukami's Wisdom",rarity:2,sortRank:15108,description:`Weapon Ascension Material.

Yet this oni would eventually betray the Shogun and revolt, becoming shorn of an arm and a horn in the battle before fleeing and slaying itself in a fit of furious madness.

In the denouement of this tale, the wounded oni fled into the forest, deathly afraid of showing himself even to the cold moonlight.

Chiyo, a warrior of the oni tribe with the Electro Mitsudomoe emblem emblazoned on her back, was once swallowed whole by a beast from beyond this world that had a tiger's body and a serpent's tail while holding back the forces of darkness. At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.
This is the origin of the phrase "Chiyo the Tiger-Bite," and would be changed over many years to "Torachiyo."
But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.
Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority.

But when cooked in a special way, the acidity actually adds to the freshness of the fish. As a result, this fish sells very well.

Under certain conditions, Maintenance Meks will treat the food of some underwater creatures as targets to be cleaned, and thus sometimes find themselves embroiled in conflicts in which they are at a disadvantage due to their small size and lack of power. Over time, an increasing number were being damaged as a result.

The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.
However, the plan to further enhance "Situation Controllers" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these "Situation Controllers" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem.

Chiyo, a warrior of the oni tribe with the Electro Mitsudomoe emblem emblazoned on her back, was once swallowed whole by a beast from beyond this world that had a tiger's body and a serpent's tail while holding back the forces of darkness. At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.
This is the origin of the phrase "Chiyo the Tiger-Bite," and would be changed over many years to "Torachiyo."
But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.
Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority.

"Who would worship a departed god?"
The Lord of Flowers was once in alliance with two other gods. Apart from wisdom and power, she also brought mercy and joy to her people.
Just as the earth needs more than the burning sunshine and pouring rain, to the people of the Lord of Flowers, joy and love, singing and music, and wine and extravagance were just as vital as strength and sensibility.
It is said that flowers blossom so that they may enjoy a spectacular death, and that death was precisely the wholehearted pursuit of the Lord of Flowers — for death adds bitterness to lost joy, and intensifies with time across endless memories.
The ignorant Lord of Deserts was never aware of her reasoning.

Ancient stone tablets record that he turned his power into seven rays of blinding light or seven pillars, which he granted equally and mercifully to everyone. No one was neglected, nor was anyone discontented.
That was a forgotten golden era, an era when the Lord of Flowers had faded into the sands and the Lord of Verdure was determined to leave. Only the descendants in the yellow sand chose to follow their god. Even as the grim shadow of calamity loomed, the power in which they had faith shone brightly like amber and gold.

This was once the God King's unfinished Grand Symphony — a boundless, sourceless golden Ichor replacing the wild primeval waters, and the glorious immortal sages bringing nectar-like enlightenment to the ignorant corners of the world.
But the God King's delusions ultimately sank into the depths of the black abyss, and with the ravages of time, the golden Ichor was eventually corroded by the primordial soup...

Even today, many mad poets and painters of Fontaine see the apocalypse experienced by Boethius, a reminder of the inescapable cycle of the world.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4503,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Artisanship",daysOfWeek:["Tuesday","Friday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114056"},version:"4.0"},{id:114060,name:"Golden Goblet of the Pristine Sea",rarity:5,sortRank:15115,description:`Weapon Ascension Material.
When the Usurper of the sunken city played the last movement of the golden symphony, the favored musician stole the golden goblet brimming with Ichor.

Afterwards, this noble thief vanished silently from history, and only the "Golden Troupe" faithfully remembers his prophecy.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4507,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Curious Contraptions",daysOfWeek:["Wednesday","Saturday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114060"},version:"4.0"}],ly=[{id:101301,name:"Birch Wood",rarity:1,sortRank:330,description:`Timber obtained from birches.
