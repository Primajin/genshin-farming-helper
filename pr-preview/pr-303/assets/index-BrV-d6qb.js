Sometimes, they even go out of their way to stay in the shallows just to get some sunshine.`,category:"EXCHANGE",typeText:"Fish",sources:["Obtained from fishing"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_131031"},version:"4.0"},{id:131037,name:"Jade Heartfeather Bass",rarity:3,sortRank:341,description:`Peculiar fish that look like a heart from the side, which are said to be related to bass.

Jade Heartfeather Bass are named for the jade-like coloration they take on in the water. Despite their gentle appearances, they possess remarkable resilience and can adapt to diverse aquatic environments. The clear water in Chenyu Vale is especially suitable for them, where they thrive and live a carefree, comfortable life.`,category:"EXCHANGE",typeText:"Fish",sources:["Obtained from fishing"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_131037"},version:"4.4"},{id:131032,name:"Maintenance Mek: Initial Configuration",rarity:3,sortRank:342,description:`Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects.

Equipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently "nose out" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as "Water Maintenance Fish" or "Iron Fish."
Made of light wood and cheap metal, this model represents the first batch of Maintenance Mek produced after achieving reliable manufacture, and possesses the fundamental capabilities required to fulfill the purpose for which they were designed. Their lifespan, however, is somewhat limited. To make up for that, this model was released in great numbers, and they work in "group shifts" – when one group stops functioning after reaching the end of their life cycle, another group that has been deployed underwater beforehand is then activated and takes the next shift. In the eyes of ordinary people, these "Iron Fishes" seem to be able to reproduce themselves in a never-ending stream. Catching a few of them from time to time is certainly no cause for a guilty conscience.`,category:"EXCHANGE",typeText:"Fish",sources:["Obtained from fishing"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_131032"},version:"4.0"},{id:131033,name:"Maintenance Mek: Water Body Cleaner",rarity:3,sortRank:342,description:`Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects.

Compared to the mass-deployed "Initial Configuration" model, the "Water Body Cleaner" model is more mature and coated with erosion-resistant material. The researchers responsible for this project introduced periodic callback and maintenance instead of just leaving them on their own after release. They would send out homing signals through flashing of a certain frequency in order to retrieve the meka, which they would then release again following maintenance and examination. Over time, certain individuals began to use this flashing method as a type of "bait" to catch these meka, and it is now widely known among the angling community.`,category:"EXCHANGE",typeText:"Fish",sources:["Obtained from fishing"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_131033"},version:"4.0"},{id:131034,name:"Maintenance Mek: Situation Controller",rarity:3,sortRank:342,description:`Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects.

Under certain conditions, Maintenance Meks will treat the food of some underwater creatures as targets to be cleaned, and thus sometimes find themselves embroiled in conflicts in which they are at a disadvantage due to their small size and lack of power. Over time, an increasing number were being damaged as a result. 
To protect the previous two models and ensure safe cleaning, researchers utilized existent frameworks and did their best to increase the power density of core structures. In the end, they developed a third model with certain combat capabilities, which was primarily designed to drive away underwater creatures by ramming into them. The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.
However, the plan to further enhance "Situation Controllers" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these "Situation Controllers" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem. As a result, researchers had to shut down some of them intentionally and restrict their offensive capabilities.`,category:"EXCHANGE",typeText:"Fish",sources:["Obtained from fishing"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_131034"},version:"4.0"},{id:131035,name:"Maintenance Mek: Platinum Collection",rarity:3,sortRank:342,description:`Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects.

Compared to the other batch-produced models, these special limited-edition "Platinum Collection" meks stand out with their clean and bright casing. When trying to attract support from wealthy merchants for the Maintenance Mek project, the development team would send them a fish tank containing one of these exquisite contraptions as a gift – and fine gifts they were indeed! Unfortunately, none of these attempts worked, so the development team adjusted their plans and tried to sell them off as toys to make up for the lack of project funds instead.
In the end, due to the accident that we all remember, the whole development team was dismissed and all of their future projects were canceled. At present, all of the remaining Maintenance Meks in Fontaine are totally unsupervised, and the "Platinum Collection" batch are no exception – they have all been lost to the water. Disappearing completely off the radar, they have turned out to be the most unique and expensive "fishes" in Fontaine. According to an in-depth investigation and cross-examination of the existing data by journalists of The Steambird, "the deployment of Maintenance Meks has not made any significant difference to the pollution levels of Fontaine's waters, and the effect of the project is still in question." Nowadays, surviving "Platinum Collection" meks still wander the waters of Fontaine, and they are considered among the most prized of catches. After all, a "Platinum Collection" mek is now as rare as the most valuable Ornamental Fish in other nations.`,category:"EXCHANGE",typeText:"Fish",sources:["Obtained from fishing"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_131035"},version:"4.0"},{id:131036,name:"Maintenance Mek: Gold Leader",rarity:3,sortRank:342,description:`Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka groups, providing aid for underwater projects.

Compared to other mass-produced models, this special "Gold Leader" assistance meka utilizes a clear gold outer casing along with special control equipment. The project team designed it to fulfill the role of a command relay station in particularly complex underwater environments, receiving and re-transmitting commands from the controller to all other meka within the group, effectively fulfilling the important role of leader.
However, as the whole maintenance meka project stopped functioning, these leader meka lost their reason for existence.

Conflicts can always be resolved by greater powers. This fact means that they can always be managed, as opposed to developing into something uncontrollable. Conflict is also a kind of limitation, preventing people from endless shirking of responsibilities without weighing the costs.

Chiyo, a warrior of the oni tribe with the Electro Mitsudomoe emblem emblazoned on her back, was once swallowed whole by a beast from beyond this world that had a tiger's body and a serpent's tail while holding back the forces of darkness. At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.
This is the origin of the phrase "Chiyo the Tiger-Bite," and would be changed over many years to "Torachiyo."
But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.
Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority.

In the myriad lore of the forest, the one in the striped cape that resembled blazing flames was the Greater Lord of the Labyrinths and the Owner of the Moon-Mirrored Spring.
When he bowed his head and struck up a friendship with the Lord of Verdure, the tokens of their friendship were the gems that glimmered like water and silver that gleamed like the moonlight.
To repay such a gesture, the Lord of Verdure promised to keep secrets for the Greater Lord of the Labyrinths and safeguard the intricate and beautiful dreams of the rainforest.

The nature of "wisdom" is not domination over all minds or scheming to gain all the benefit. Instead, it is about empowering even ordinary beings to one day overcome their imposed constraints.

People used to say that the Lord of Flowers was the Lord of Joy and Happiness. Freshwater sprang from her sleeves, and thus was the oasis of blossoming flowers born in the desert. Flowers and grasses followed in her footsteps, and gleaming moonlight cleared the way for her.

The Lord of Flowers was in an amicable relationship with the Jinn.
The Mistress of Flowers and Oases joined hands with the Lord of Deserts and built Ay-Khanoum, the "City of Amphitheaters," which carried the meaning of "City of the Moon Maiden" in the ancient language of the Jinn.
Later, however, it was said that the Lord of Flowers died due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand, after which the blossoms of purple Padisarahs were never seen again in the oases.
After the departure of the Lord of Flowers, the sandstorms keened, the Jinn sobbed, and the moonlight-silver gem disc lost its original, glad purpose, giving off a mournful glimmer.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4376,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Obsession",daysOfWeek:["Tuesday","Friday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114043"},version:"3.0"},{id:114044,name:"Oasis Garden's Truth",rarity:5,sortRank:15111,description:`Weapon Ascension Material.
"Who would worship a departed god?"
The Lord of Flowers was once in alliance with two other gods. Apart from wisdom and power, she also brought mercy and joy to her people.
Just as the earth needs more than the burning sunshine and pouring rain, to the people of the Lord of Flowers, joy and love, singing and music, and wine and extravagance were just as vital as strength and sensibility.
It is said that flowers blossom so that they may enjoy a spectacular death, and that death was precisely the wholehearted pursuit of the Lord of Flowers — for death adds bitterness to lost joy, and intensifies with time across endless memories.
The ignorant Lord of Deserts was never aware of her reasoning.

In the era when the ignorant Lord of Deserts ruled, his power descended upon every inch of the land like the scorching sun.
Ancient stone tablets record that he turned his power into seven rays of blinding light or seven pillars, which he granted equally and mercifully to everyone. No one was neglected, nor was anyone discontented.
That was a forgotten golden era, an era when the Lord of Flowers had faded into the sands and the Lord of Verdure was determined to leave. Only the descendants in the yellow sand chose to follow their god. Even as the grim shadow of calamity loomed, the power in which they had faith shone brightly like amber and gold.

When intangible spirits attach themselves to objects, they merge and transform into various forms through a process known as spiritual fusion. Once this has taken place, these spirits are capable of conveying dreamlike visions to humans in a state of trance.
It fell upon those who frequently engaged in such dialogues with the spirits to interpret these vision-like dreams, translating omens from beneath the earth into language that could be understood by the tribe, or transforming their warnings into stories.

Eventually, the Wayob came to be capable of conveying revelations of the Night Kingdom through various thoughts alone, dispensing of the need for devotees to perform the ritual of polishing stones into mirrors. Thus were such ritual tools rendered obsolete.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4393,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Estimation",daysOfWeek:["Wednesday","Saturday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114072"},version:"5.0"}],sy=[{id:101301,name:"Birch Wood",rarity:1,sortRank:330,description:`Timber obtained from birches.

Among sticklebacks, this sort would either count as the proudest, or a rather close second place. They are especially prickly during courtships, where even the slightest breeze or smallest ripple might trip their fuse. A hobbyist once observed one such specimen charging at waving seagrass, as if such flagrant dancing was some major provocation against the stickleback king or something.

The meaning that lies behind the name "Watatsumi" is simply the unrequited hopes that the abandoned people who dwelt in the deep sea pinned upon the serpent god that led them.
And it was also because the serpent god now had people who worshiped it that it stayed in the world it should have long fled, breaking off the coral branches that adorned its body, treading upon land where it should not have, and facing a foe it could never hope to match — till at last, its divine form was sundered along with the mountains, its ichor turned into plasma, and its will and power became a curse that could never be extinguished: Tatarigami.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4343,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Sunken Sands",daysOfWeek:["Monday","Thursday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114028"},version:""},{id:114032,name:"Narukami's Valor",rarity:5,sortRank:15108,description:`Weapon Ascension Material.

Chiyo, a warrior of the oni tribe with the Electro Mitsudomoe emblem emblazoned on her back, was once swallowed whole by a beast from beyond this world that had a tiger's body and a serpent's tail while holding back the forces of darkness. At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.
This is the origin of the phrase "Chiyo the Tiger-Bite," and would be changed over many years to "Torachiyo."
But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.
Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind is perhaps not merely monodirectional.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4363,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Sand Burial",daysOfWeek:["Wednesday","Saturday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114036"},version:""},{id:114040,name:"Golden Talisman of the Forest Dew",rarity:5,sortRank:15110,description:`Weapon Ascension Material.

The nature of "wisdom" is not domination over all minds or scheming to gain all the benefit. Instead, it is about empowering even ordinary beings to one day overcome their imposed constraints.

"Who would worship a departed god?"
The Lord of Flowers was once in alliance with two other gods. Apart from wisdom and power, she also brought mercy and joy to her people.
Just as the earth needs more than the burning sunshine and pouring rain, to the people of the Lord of Flowers, joy and love, singing and music, and wine and extravagance were just as vital as strength and sensibility.
It is said that flowers blossom so that they may enjoy a spectacular death, and that death was precisely the wholehearted pursuit of the Lord of Flowers — for death adds bitterness to lost joy, and intensifies with time across endless memories.
The ignorant Lord of Deserts was never aware of her reasoning. He only reveled in her immense charm and grace — and as misguided as such fervent affections might be, they were well within the calculations of the Lord of Flowers.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4377,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Obsession",daysOfWeek:["Tuesday","Friday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114044"},version:"3.0"},{id:114048,name:"Olden Days of Scorching Might",rarity:5,sortRank:15112,description:`Weapon Ascension Material.
In the era when the ignorant Lord of Deserts ruled, his power descended upon every inch of the land like the scorching sun.
Ancient stone tablets record that he turned his power into seven rays of blinding light or seven pillars, which he granted equally and mercifully to everyone. No one was neglected, nor was anyone discontented.
That was a forgotten golden era, an era when the Lord of Flowers had faded into the sands and the Lord of Verdure was determined to leave. Only the descendants in the yellow sand chose to follow their god. Even as the grim shadow of calamity loomed, the power in which they had faith shone brightly like amber and gold.
Yet calamity befell nonetheless, and the golden insectoid insignias were buried beneath the depths of shrine and palace, under collapsed pillars engraved with images of eagles and bulls.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4381,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Leading Karma",daysOfWeek:["Wednesday","Saturday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114048"},version:"3.0"},{id:114052,name:"Echo of an Ancient Chord",rarity:5,sortRank:15113,description:`Weapon Ascension Material.
The God King's Grand Symphony is composed of countless melodies linked together, but its main thesis is submerged under the common destiny of the Water Nation.
The harmonies of those carefree years and sonatas were once the greatest representation of civilization and order, but when the prosperous empire descended into a playground for tyrants, the brutal despots tore the connection with the source asunder under the cover of golden cloaks, and discord finally swarmed through the empire—

A dense and pure solution, derived and refined from drops of the vast primordial sea. The ancient God King once believed it would bring eternal life and infinite wisdom, but listening carefully— it was quietly, faintly prophesizing the final end of all dissolving into one.
This was once the God King's unfinished Grand Symphony — a boundless, sourceless golden Ichor replacing the wild primeval waters, and the glorious immortal sages bringing nectar-like enlightenment to the ignorant corners of the world.
But the God King's delusions ultimately sank into the depths of the black abyss, and with the ravages of time, the golden Ichor was eventually corroded by the primordial soup...
The tuner turned a blind eye to the evil omens, and supporting his broken body, continued to give life to his compatriots according to the plans once laid, so that the old order might one day return...

"If you wish to possess all that the world has to offer, you must first offer all you have to the world."
After the Sacred Lord of the ineffable city forbade the people from praying to the Night Kingdom, the spiritual bonds that had once been established fell into ruin.
The scarlet-eyed youth, guided through numerous trials, now faced his final test: to emulate the first human to ascend and confront his own demise by offering up his heart with a golden dagger.
Self-sacrifice was seen as an honor reserved for the victor — and thus, without even a moment's hesitation, he sliced open his chest with the gleaming blade.
In the end, his sacrifice received the response it deserved, and he was able to return from the kingdom where water flows as rays of light to set out upon a grand new endeavor.`,category:"AVATAR_MATERIAL",typeText:"Weapon Ascension Material",dropDomainId:4385,dropDomainName:"Domain of Forgery: Scrying Shadows",daysOfWeek:["Monday","Thursday","Sunday"],sources:["Crafted"],images:{filename_icon:"UI_ItemIcon_114064"},version:"5.0"},{id:114068,name:"Delirious Divinity of the Sacred Lord",rarity:5,sortRank:15117,description:`Weapon Ascension Material.

It is said that when the scarlet-eyed youth burned down that city above a city, submerged in shadow as it was, he witnessed a half-human figure before the royal hall who had been driven mad. As if tearing off its very face, it ripped away at its indelible divine visage, revealing gaping holes that were fearsomely draconic.

Regardless of how they are polished, representations of worldly matter cannot be made to transcend their physical nature — they will always remain material in essence. Similarly, pure human spirit can neither be expressed solely through the "tree" of intention, nor embodied through obsidian mirrors that need constant polishing. As the power of the Night Kingdom and the Nightsouls grew, so too did the types of objects that could be used for spiritual fusion. Eventually, the Wayob came to be capable of conveying revelations of the Night Kingdom through various thoughts alone, dispensing of the need for devotees to perform the ritual of polishing stones into mirrors.
